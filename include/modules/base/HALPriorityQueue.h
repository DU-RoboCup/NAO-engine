// FILE DESCRIPTION
This class is a Priority Queue used for managing the order in which intents are 
are sent to NAOqi. This may be useful if you wish to have high priority items
quickly sent to the NAO (either Hardware Write Requests or Hardware Reads). 

This class utilizes a few C++14 features.
